- Future.cancel() does not always stop the poller thread; create our own flag for stopping them
- one of the participants (HKI 4.12.2012) used an obscure Python web server which killed the participant poller (bug with the http client?)
	- reproduce the issue and fix the immediate problem
	OK - make polling more failure resistant, perhaps restart the pollers periodically and recreate the http client
	- consider using a different HTTP client
- improve the performance of saving application state
	- benchmark using an old save state
	- without pretty-printing: pr, pr-str, read-string
	- some other library, for example https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy
- split challenges module to challenge-fn and challenge
- allow challenges to return non-string answers, stringify automatically
- use a DB for persistence
	- evaluate OrientDB
- new game ideas?
	- multiplayer AI game based on http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/battle-city
